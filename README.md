# CS50s-Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence-with-Python
#### My work for edX's CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python, a course by HarvardX an online learning initiative by Harvard University.

CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By course’s end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own.
### The Course had a Total of 7 lectures covering the following topics along with a quiz for each topic:

| **SR. No** | **Leacture** | **Quiz** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Search | Quiz0 |
| 2. | Knowledge | Quiz1 |
| 3. | Uncertainty | Quiz2 |
| 4. | Optimization | Quiz3 |
| 5. | Learning | Quiz4 |
| 6. | Neural Networks | Quiz5 |
| 7. | Language | Quiz6 |

###  The course also had a total of 7 Projects to be submitted to pass the course. These were:
1. **Project 0**: Degrees and Tic-Tac-Toe
2. **Project 1**: Knights and Minesweeper
3. **Project 2**: PageRank and Heredity
4. **Project 3**: Crossword
5. **Project 4**: Shopping and Nim
6. **Project 5**: Traffic
7. **Project 6**: Parser and Questions
